# Contribute to manual

## What can I do?

You now have three ways to contribute to the writing of the manual.

* ****[**Translate**](../#language-support) content into your own language
* Report a content error, submit [**Issue**](https://github.com/panda-lsy/HMCL-PE-User-Manual/issues) on Github
* Submit new content using [**Pull Request**](https://github.com/panda-lsy/HMCL-PE-User-Manual/pulls)****

## Being a translator

In writing the manual, the administrator found that most of the people in **Discord** are not **native English speakers**, so the complex English tutorials **make it difficult** for them to read. You can use translation software to first translate the English content into your own language, then **embellish it** with spoken language and finally make the manual accessible to a wider audience.

### How?

You can do this by changing the file directly and submitting a [**Pull Request**](https://github.com/panda-lsy/HMCL-PE-User-Manual/pulls) for translation.

#### Get a Github Account

You can sign up for a free Github account with your own email address and contribute to the manual.&#x20;
