# Download Optifine

### There are two ways to install Optifine:

#### Like Forge, use the [one-click install feature](download-forge-fabric-liteloader.md) when installing a minecraft version

#### Using the MOD version of Optifine, this can be removed relatively easily. But it requires Forge

You need to download it from the [official website](https://optifine.net/downloads).

If you need more versions, please click on the button marked in red.

If you can't stand the ads before the download, you can click (mirror) to use the mirror download. (It may be faster)

{% hint style="info" %}
Before you download it , please make sure you have a correct version of Forge installed on Minecraft.

Then you need to drag it to the mods folder.
