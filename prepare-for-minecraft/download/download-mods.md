# Download Mods

There may be some problems with MODS downloads, so I will briefly explain how to download MODS using HMCL-PE or Curseforge.

### HMCL-PE

[**Open the download page** ](./#open-the-download-page-of-hmcl-pe)**of HMCL-PE,then find this:**

**Games:**Your minecraft version name, and if you have [version isolation](../../basic-settings/global-game-settings/working-directory.md) turned on, you can freely switch the target version folder you downloaded to.

**Download Source:**The source of the Mod you downloaded.

**Name:**The name of the mod, you can search by Chinese or English.

**Game Version:**minecraft version, it can be searched according to the minecraft version supported by the mod.

**Category:**Search by category of MOD

**Sort by:**Search by specific parameters

{% hint style="info" %}
After you download the mod, you don't need to install it, because HMCL-PE will automatically move the mod to your corresponding version folder.

But I still suggest you check the [Mod Installing](../installing/installing-mods.md) part, which covers issues you need to be aware of.
{% endhint %}

### **Curseforge**

**You can click on the link to go to CurseForge**

****[**link**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods)****

It's a simple matter of how to download the modules, but you still need to pay attention to the following issues.

* MODs downloaded from curseforge need to be installed into HMCL-PE's minecraft from your browser's download folder **by yourself.**
* Before downloading, you need to pay attention to whether the mod supports the corresponding minecraft version
* You need to check whether the mod is a Forge or Fabric version.

I put more space on the [Mod Installing](../installing/installing-mods.md) section, you can skip to that section to continue browsing.
