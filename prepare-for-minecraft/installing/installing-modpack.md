# Installing Modpack

{% hint style="danger" %}
**HMCL-PE currently does not have the ability to install Curseforge's Modpack with one click or download Modpack from link, please be patient for the new version.**
{% endhint %}

With that in mind, you still have two ways to download and install Modpacks.

### Computer Helpers

Install Curseforge's Modpack using the PC version of the launcher, and then transfer the files to your phone.

The launcher for the Curseforge integration package is currently known to install

* [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/)
* [Plain Craft Launcher 2](https://afdian.net/p/e5c821a4b1ab11eb879b52540025c377)
* [Hello Minecraft! Launcher](https://hmcl.huangyuhui.net/)
* And many more

Once you get the version file, just zip it up, transfer it to your phone and unzip it again.

You can also unzip only some of the files and use the HMCL-PE resource files(You need to use HMCL-PE to download a correct version of minecraft, including Forge or Fabric should also be installed in advance, but there can not be MODS and other files inside.)

You have to compress and transfer the folder to the phone:

* config(Modpack authors change the game mechanics of the mod by modifying the Config file, which can cause the changed file to be different from the initial one.)
* mods
* resourcepacks
* resources(Resource Loader Mod's resource file, usually used for language localization, and modifying the mod's resources.)
* scripts(CraftTweaker Mod's recipe modification file)
* saves
* servers.dat(Server list file)

Finally, you just need to drag these files into your installed[ minecraft version folder](../some-tips-about-file-location.md)

### Server-side Thief(No computer required)

On Curseforge, the server side is usually several times the size of the client side.

This is because the mods are placed on the server side in advance.

Before you can download the server side, **you need to install the correct version of minecraft (including Forge)**

You just need to unzip the downloaded server package and drag the folder into minecraft's version folder.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Attention:

1.The server side of some Modpack is very small, because the author edited the .bat file and needs to download the module resources online on the computer.

2.The server-side MOD may be different from the client-side MOD, which will not affect the content of your game, but may affect the play._Because Modpack authors may remove mods that have no effect on the server side, but play a supporting role on the client side when making the server side._
