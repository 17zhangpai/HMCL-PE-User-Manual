# Installing Mods

### Check version and Mod loader

Before installing a mod, you need to check it carefully.

* [ ] Check the MOD version:The latest version of the mod fixes more BUGS and has more features, but if you are using MODPACK or playing in a specific environment, it is recommended not to update.
* [ ] Check if your mod already exists:you need to check in Manage MODPACK
* [ ] Check that your MOD version corresponds to your version of the game
* [ ] Check if the mod supports your mod loader(like forge,fabric) and whether the mod loader version is appropriate.
* [ ] Check if your mods will conflict with each other (based on experience and previous Crash-reports)
* [ ] Check if HMCL-PE is compatible with this mod([Click for a list of incompatible mods](../../mod-helper/incompatible-mods.md))

### Install MODS using your own file manager

You need to open the file manager and copy the mod files you downloaded into the mods folder

You don't know where the MODS folder is? It is in the[ version folder](../some-tips-about-file-location.md).
