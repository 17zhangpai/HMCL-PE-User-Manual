# Multiplayer

You need to make sure that two people have downloaded the **exact same Minecraft** before playing in multiplayer, otherwise it is prone to problems.

The same file is required(If your minecraft version folder does not have certain folders, you can ignore):

* config
* mods
* resourcepacks
* scripts(CraftTweaker Mod's recipe modification file)

You have five ways to play multiplayer games

* **Go find a server created by someone else**, download the corresponding client, get the server IP and connect.
* Use HMCL-PE's **built-in multiplayer function**
* **Online in the same Wifi**
* **Buy a server or VPS**, or use "**intranet penetration**" for online access
