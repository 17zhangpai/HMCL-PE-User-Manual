# Costume Skin

If you are an offline login player, I recommend that you log in to an account using Authentication Server as soon as possible. The best way to do this is to purchase a Microsoft Minecraft account

In HMCL-PE, if you are using an offline account, there are three ways to change the skin.

* Local skin file
* Authentication Server's name
* Default(Steve/Alex)
