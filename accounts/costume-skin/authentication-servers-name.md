# Authentication Server's name

To change your skin, you need to open HMCL-PE, click on the "Accounts" button and click on this "hanger" button on the right side of your created character.

When you click the Littleskin or Blessing skin button, it will automatically correspond to the nickname from the skin server's account and find the skin for that nickname.

If you have not logged into an Authentication Server account before, then say you are lucky, but also unfortunate that a player with the same nickname as you has hijacked the name on this skin server, which means that even if you register this account on the skin server, you can no longer use this name.

If you have already registered your Authentication Server account, please do not use the offline login to change the skin if it is not necessary, it is better to use Authentication Server to login HMCL-PE.[(Click to jump to the corresponding section)](../add-an-account/authentication-server-login/login-via-authentication-server/authlib-injector.md)

{% hint style="info" %}
It is worth noting that the Authentication Server skin is theoretically invisible to others in multiplayer online games, but can be [**adjusted**](multiplayer-game-display.md) to make it visible to others.
