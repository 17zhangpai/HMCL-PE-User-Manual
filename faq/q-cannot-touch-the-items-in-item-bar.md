# Q:Cannot touch the items in item bar

### A:You need to change the [Resolution](../ji-chu-she-zhi/global-game-settings/resolution.md).Turn it up, the exact value you need to try yourself...

{% hint style="info" %}
You can use the dichotomy method:

If you are now at 50%, you can try adjusting to (50%+100%)/2=75%,If it still doesn't work, you can adjust to (75% + 100%)/2=88%.

This is the fastest way to do it, while your resolution is not modified too much.
{% endhint %}
