### Renderer

You have two ways to render the game.

#### Holy GL4ES(OpenGL 2.1/3.2)

This renderer is more stable(Manual writer's test conclusions, for reference only)

#### VirGLRenderer(OpenGL4.3)

This renderer will give your game a higher FPS(Manual writer's test conclusions, for reference only)

### FAQ

Q:When I use the VirGLRenderer, the game screen turns white during startup and the colors become confused.

A:You need to change the [Resolution](resolution.md).
